My name is Marc Weitz and I am currently doing my PhD in Computer
Science and Public Health at the university of Tromsø. Before that I studied Cognitive Science at the university of Tübingen with
focus on language processing, neuronal information processing, mutlimodal integration, statistical modelling and machine learning. I am a big fan of open software and open science so I try to make most of the things I do publicly available. For more
information on projects I worked on or on which I am currently
working, have a look at my [projects page](/projects/).

Besides my studies, I worked as a research assistant at the [Quantitative Linguistics
lab of Harald Baayen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/quantitative-linguistics/) and
as a teaching assistant for various courses within the Cognitive Science and the
Computer Science bachelor programmes at the university of Tübingen. During my
time at the Quantitative Linguistics lab, I mainly worked as a software
developer and maintainer on the python package [pyndl](https://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
which is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/quantling/pyndl/).

In my free time, I am a passionate hiker, cycler, climber and runner.
