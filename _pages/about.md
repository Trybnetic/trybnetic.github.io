My name is Marc Weitz and I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the university of Tromsø where I am doing research on the next generation of accelerometry, the methodology to meassure human behavior with small body-worn sensors called accelerometers. Before that I studied Cognitive Science at the university of Tübingen with focus on language processing, neuronal information processing, mutlimodal integration, statistical modelling and machine learning. I am a big fan of open software and open science so I try to make most of the things I do publicly available. For more information on projects I worked on or on which I am currently working, have a look at my [projects page](/projects/).

Besides my studies, I worked as a research assistant at the [Quantitative Linguistics lab of Harald Baayen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/quantitative-linguistics/) and as a teaching assistant for various courses within the Cognitive Science and the Computer Science bachelor programmes at the university of Tübingen. During my time at the Quantitative Linguistics lab, I mainly worked as a software developer and maintainer on the python package [pyndl](https://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/quantling/pyndl/).

In my free time, I am a passionate hiker, cycler, climber and runner. In particular, I love doing long-distance and endurance stuff like hiking for a week or longer, run long distances preferably in the mountains and cycle over weeks and months. My, so far, most challenging adventure was a three month bike trip from southern Germany to the bike trip and back, but many adventures are still waiting.
