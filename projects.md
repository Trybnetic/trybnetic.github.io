Here on this site you can find a selection of projects I am currently working on or I have worked on.
Even though I try to give you a good overview please also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Trybnetic), leave a star on projects you like or follow me on GitHub.

### Minimalist
[Minimalist](https://trybnetic.github.io/minimalist/) is a simple and light weighted [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme. It focuses on a minimalistic design but still providing all functionality for a personal blog. For more information, e.g. how to use it, check out the [repository's](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist) [Readme](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist/blob/master/README.md). This blog is also using minimalist and was the motivation writing it. So if you like it, feel free to fork it and make it fit to your needs.
