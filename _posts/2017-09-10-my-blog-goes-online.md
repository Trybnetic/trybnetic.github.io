Finally, my own blog goes online after spending lots of time on developing the
design. Besides this blog I am happy to contribute to the open source movement
with my first jekyll theme
[Minimalist](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist/). Although it may still
have some bugs I am happy that it is now insofar finished as it can now be used
as a full functional personal blog.

Nevertheless, developing software is a continuous task. So if you find any bugs
in my blog or in the Minimalist theme itself. Please submit an issue at the
[repository on Github](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist/issues/). I will
try to fix it!

But back to my blog: A lot of people asked me why I want to start my own blog in
 times of Twitter and Facebook. It is simple! For me the Internet should be free
 and not be controlled by companies such as Twitter or Facebook. Although, my
blog is currently hosted on Github I am free to host it anywhere I want. And
this is a major difference to company based blogging on Facebook or Twitter
where you get regulated by their terms of service. Using a blog you are free
to host in on Github or to rent or to run your own server.
