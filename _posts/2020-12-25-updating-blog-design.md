After three years, I finally updated the design of my blog. When I wrote the [Minimalist](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist/) jekyll theme in 2017, I was interested in all the functionality static website generators provide and was obviously curious to try it out myself. Now, three years later, [Minimalist](https://github.com/Trybnetic/minimalist/) is my most starred and forked repository on Github, but nevertheless I decided its time for something new.

Therefore, I forked the famous [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository from Github and adapted it to my needs. Most importantly, I wanted to add space for my "a book, a week" challenge, I did last year and which I aim to follow up again soon. During the time of the challenge, I tried to read on book each week, which after some weeks resulted in a lack of inspiration. Other bloggers who did a similar challenge were therefore good sources of new book ideas. For that reason, I want to present my reading list as well as some of you might be interested in doing similar things and, on the other hand, I truly believe that what a person reads already tells you a lot about someone.
