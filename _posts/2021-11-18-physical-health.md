What do we know actually about physical activity? The past week, I attended a
seminar in Kirstiansand that addressed exactly this question: What do we evidently
know about physical activity? I guess everyone has a concept of it, but does this
actually align with what the experts in the field are saying?

I had now for close to a year the pleasure to work on the intersection of physical
activity research and Computer Science (Yes, this is actually a thing!), but with my
background in Cognitive Science my knowledge about physical activity and its effects on
health and the body itself were rather limited. I had some basic ideas or probably
rather concepts in mind that are likely familiar to many people: Sport is good.
Being active is good. But else? Due to my position as a PhD candidate at the intersection
of these fields, I already knew that there are several guidelines for physical activity
from different health authorities (among others including the
[WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015128), the
[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/resources/recommendations.html)
and many others). I had further an idea of what they are: About 150min per week spent
in moderate-to-vigorous activity (often simply called MVPA which is significantly
more friendly for your tongue) in bouts of 10min. I even have one of these modern
smart watches that give you estimates for this, but still I had no idea what I actually
have to imagine by this. So what is this, what do we know and what does it mean? All
these and many more questions got answered this week by top experts in the field.

## Why are we actually interested in physical activity?

I think the first question that many people might ask is: Why actually care? Why
does the tax payer actually fund people to work on this. Historically speaking,
and this was mentioned throughout the course probably as often as psychologists show
a picture of Wilhelm Wundt, the inventor of evidence-based or experimental psychology,
in a bus in London. [Morris et al. (1953)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(53)90665-5)
observed in London buses that the drivers had a significantly decreased life expectancy
compared with conductors working in the same environment. As a fundamental difference
between the two occupations was the amount of activity, an association between physical
activity and mortality seems to exist.

Easy isn't it? Sadly it is not also because if it was, the research of physical activity
would probably have been settled already some decades ago. A huge problem, and this
is seems to be a reoccurring theme in the field, is that a wide range of factors are all associated
with each other. Later analysis of the Morris data, for instance, showed another
equally important associations: Not only a difference in physical activity existed,
also a difference in uniform size (as a proxy of weight and obesity) was found. In fact,
many different closely related variables have been found which all to a certain extend seem
to be associated with each other.

## What causes what? The problem of causality

We humans like the principle of causality. Something alway has to be the
reason for something else and if we cannot explain it is god, magic or the flying
spaghetti monster that is causing it. Quite often, however, we humans mix associations
or correlations with causation. In fact we cannot determine whether the observation Y
is caused by the co-observation X. I can, just from observation, always be also
the other way around (Y causing X) or funnily enough none of these (for some ridiculous
not related correlations see [here](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)).

The British epidemiologist [Sir Bradford Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Bradford_Hill)
developed for this reason [nine criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria)
that are required for causality. As especially, the criteria of temporarily is not
given in cross-sectional observations (snapshots at one time step looking on what
occurs together with what), [Randomized controll trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial)
are used to determine causal relationships. But before looking at what we know
about these relationships, it is necessary to define what physical activity actually is.

## Activity = Activity?

What is actually activity? The naive definition is that activity is everything
which is not inactive (in PA research language called sedentary time; from latin
sedere "to sit"). But is it so easy? Are a walk, a run and a sprint all have the
same influence? Does it matter whether you spent hours on your bike or in the gym?
What we know is that some intensity classes seem to exist. So activities can be
grouped by their intensity into groups that share roughly the same amount of
[metabolic equivalents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task)
(METs). METs are a measure of the rate a person expends energy relative to the
mass of the body and is used to objectively access the intensity of an activity.

Experiments suggested that three different classes of activity exist: light, moderate
and vigorous activity. For each class thresholds exists for the different assessment
methods of activity. The classes itself are backed by the physiological mechanisms
underlying physical activity.

## How are the different activity classes meassured?

So how do researchers access physical activity? Traditionally, physical activity
is often accessed using questionnaires like the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ). These method is nowadays considered as not really
accurate which is easily relate-able when you think of how accurate you think your
answer would be if someone asked how "How many minutes a day are you doing
moderate to vigorous activities?". This example might be a bit exaggerating, but
many studies showed that this kind of assessment is evidently biased by giving
[answeres that tend to be what is socially expected](https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2000.11082780).

The field is therefore moving slowly towards small devices called accelerometers which measure
activity in terms of acceleration (no acceleration = no activity). However, these
devices also come with some disadvantages as, for instance, a higher burden for the participants
and a systematic underestimation of activity as participants likely sometimes do not
wear them (and should not, for instance, if the sensor is not waterproofed, etc)
under some activities. Despite these limitations, the use of accelerometers is usually
concluded to be significantly more accurate than questionnaires.

I think it is important to highlight that biases are a problem all over the place
in Science and knowing that these biases exist and aiming to figure out what these
biases are is the best you can do as a scientist.

## A small self-experiment

Interesting for me was also to experience the whole procedure of professional physical activity assessment myself. In the
preface of the course we all got handed out accelerometers to measure our own
activity in the days before and during the experiment. This was of particular interest,
as I figured out that I had a significant misconception of what the respective
activity intensities actually are. I always thought that MVPA is a workout style
activity including sweat, resistance and endurance, but actually it isn't.

Even though, I was also on two shorter runs in that week, the main contribution to my measured
physical activity was given by a longer really relaxed hike on the weekend. Nothing
exhaustive, just good old walking.

## Guidelines, Interventions and eternal life

Getting accurate measures, understanding the physiological mechanisms, even screening
and monitoring whole populations is one side, but at the end an important question lies
also in the application of all of this research. As mentioned already in the beginning,
a substantial amount of experts around the world are working in developing new or
updating existing guidelines to increase global health and well-being. My impression
was that the field here is currently in a paradigm shift caused by the use of accelerometers.
For over a decade now the official guidelines of the world health organization recommend
150 minutes of 10 minute bouts of MVPA, recently updated to 150-300 minutes of MVPA.
From what I could infer, it seems to exists some discrepancies as these values
were derived based on questionnaires which as discussed earlier are subject to
several biases overestimating the amount of physical activity that is needed for
a healthy and long life.

A huge surprise to me, however, was the distribution of physical activity in various
populations indicating a severe trend of a highly skewed distribution towards the
physical inactivity side. In other words: We see a huge amount of people
being really inactive and only a few people being really active. Given the bounded
nature of the physical activity scale a skew is not unsurprising. We can observe this
in Science in many occasions as for instance in reaction time experiments in humans
and animals, but the amount of skewness still surprised me and my impression was
that these distributional characteristics are understudied. Especially, as they
appear to have a huge impact on how interventions and policies that should be implemented:
Should interventions focus on increasing physical activity among all people or
should we aim "unskewing" this distribution by intervening on those who are most
inactive.

Ironically, these group of rather inactive people are on the same hand the least
studied group because besides all the different variables that are associated with
each other (physical inactivity, poor health, low socioeconomic status and many more),
these are also associated with lower engagement and motivation to participate
in this kind of studies, resulting in Science done by scientists researching
on scientist producing results that give us insights about scientists as so often
men did research on men reporting results about men. This is provocatively written
and obviously exaggerating a lot, but a huge problem nevertheless. But and this I
think is very important, I was highly impressed by how clear and open all these
experts talked about this problem. How clearly they stated the problems and are
aiming to overcome these and I think this is the best and probably only way to
address problems like this as scientists.

## Summary

So what did I infect learn? Definitively more than I can describe in this summary. The
field of physical activity research is not easy. The scientists in this field have
to deal with a whole bunch of highly interconnected and -correlated factors and
have simultaneously to deal with many of the sampling and bias problems you have when you do research
on and with humans. And still, they have come a long way. Even though, the magnitude
of effect that physical activity has on different-cause mortality, quality of life or other co-factors
is not exactly known, I feel it is save to say that being and staying physical active
is really important and simultaneously the guidelines that are out there are not
so difficult to fulfill. On the same side, I was really surprised about the magnitude
of inactivity that seems to be apparent. I understand now why people sometimes speak
about the [physical inactivity pandemic](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60898-8) and
think more effort should be done addressing this problem.

So instead reading and procrastinating you should have spend this time, for instance,
going for walk, do a small hike, or just for a quick bike trip to a cafe in the
next city.
